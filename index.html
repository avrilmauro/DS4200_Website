        <p class="body-text">Hi! My name is Avril and I have a passion for dance.</p>
        <p class="body-text">I am currently a senior at Northeastern University, graduating in May with a B.S. in Data Science & Business. On top of being a full time student, I work part-time as a Strategy & Analytics Analyst and I am on a competitive Hip-Hop dance team. In this website, I'll take you through some of my experiences in the Boston Dance Community.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Dance is a hobby I began in high school where I used to be part of a studio which competed in many styles including Hip-Hop but also other styles like Lyrical, Jazz, and Contemporary. I enjoy each dance style in their own way, but Hip-Hop definitely holds a special place in my heart. </p>

        <h2 class="subheader">Why Dance?</h2>
        <p class="body-text">I love dance because it’s such a great way to express myself, both creatively and emotionally. It lets me communicate in a way words can’t. Plus, it’s super active, so it keeps me in shape while having fun. Dance has also introduced me to so many incredible people who share the same passion, creating a strong community. On top of that, it’s an art form that I find incredibly aesthetic—whether it’s the smoothness of a move or the energy of a performance. Dance brings together creativity, fitness, connection, and beauty, making it something I truly enjoy.</p>
