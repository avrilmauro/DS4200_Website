    <p class="description"> The piece above is inspired by the DJ, Kaytranada. It is a 5.5 minute set comprised of 4 songs from the DJ featuring several artists including UGH UGH feat. Amine, Lover/Friend feat. Rochelle Jordan, Worst in Me feat. Tinashe, 10% Feat. Kali Uchis, and Vex Oh feat. GoldLink.
    The composition of multiple songs and choreographies together is called a Set, and this one was particularly fun and energy-filled. Five members from our team choreographed sections of the piece and it was strung together by our Artistic Director. At showcases, we received praise for both our performance and our stellar outfits which were "European Brunch" themed.
    This set won us 3rd place at one of the Boston-wide competitions last semester! </p>

        <h2 class="subheader">Some Context on Hip Hop</h2>
        <p class="body-text"> Hip hop dance started in the 1970s in the Bronx, New York, as part of the city's street culture. It includes styles like breaking (breakdancing), locking, and popping—each with its own unique moves. Breaking features acrobatic floor work, locking is all about quick, sharp movements with pauses, and popping focuses on precise muscle contractions that create jerky, controlled motions. These styles grew out of the desire to express individuality, often in dance battles or community events.
        Today, hip hop is a major part of Boston's dance scene, especially in local colleges. The city's vibrant culture provides plenty of opportunities for dancers to learn, create, and perform. From dance crews to competitions and workshops, Boston offers a space where both beginners and pros can explore hip hop. It’s now a key influence in everything from competitive dance to fun performances. </p>
